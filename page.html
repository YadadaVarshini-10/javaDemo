  <p><span><a href="https://signup.oraclecloud.com/">Java</a></span> is a versatile, object-oriented programming language<br> 
    widely used for developing various applications, including<br> 
    web applications, Android apps, and enterprise software.It's<br>
    known for its platform independence, meaning you canwrite <br>
    <span><a href="https://signup.oraclecloud.com/">Java</a></span> code once and run it on different operating systems.<br>
    <span><a href="https://signup.oraclecloud.com/">Java</a></span>also emphasizes security, allowing developers to build<br>
    robust applications. </p>

    <h3>Platform Independence:</h3>
    <p>
      Java's code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which<br>
      acts as an intermediary between the code and the underlying<br>
      operating system. This allows Java programs to execute on<br>
      any device with a compatible JVM, regardless of the specific<br>
      operating system. 
    </p>

    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h3>
    <p>
      Java's core principles revolve around object-oriented programming,<br>
      which promotes modularity, code reuse, and maintainability. It <br>
      utilizes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism<br>
      to structure code effectively.
